### R2D9: Tues, Jan 9th, 2018

**Progress**: Got started on a Udemy course, Git a Web Developer Job: Mastering the Modern Workflow.

__Thoughts__: Really going to try to fly through this course, as I'm thinking it should be mostly just review and seems to be not too long at all.

### R2D11: Thurs, Jan 11th, 2018

**Progress**: Intro to Gulp & PostCSS.
